Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. 
These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. AI is used in various fields such as healthcare, finance, 
education, and autonomous vehicles.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and 
make predictions or decisions based on data. Deep Learning, a subset of ML, uses neural networks to analyze various factors 
of data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that gives machines the ability to read, understand, and respond to human 
languages. It is used in applications like chatbots, translation tools, and sentiment analysis.

As technology advances, AI continues to grow in capability and influence, raising both opportunities and ethical concerns 
about its impact on society.
